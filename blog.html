            <h3>How I Built My First Power BI Dashboard</h3>
            <p>When I first started learning Power BI, I was nervous because it looked complicated. 
            But after watching tutorials and practicing, I was able to create a simple dashboard 
            showing students’ participation in different university activities. 
            It was fun and made me realize how data can tell stories.</p>

            <h3>My Experience in the UNESCO Youth Club</h3>
            <p>Being part of the UNESCO Youth Club has helped me grow as a person. 
            I have learned teamwork, organization, and how to contribute to projects that help others. 
            I am currently part of the sponsorship and partnerships team, and we focus on supporting 
            projects related to education and sustainability.</p>

            <h3>Balancing School Work and Football</h3>
            <p>Sometimes it’s not easy being a student and still finding time for sports. 
            But playing football helps me relieve stress and stay fit. 
            I always make sure I plan my time properly so I can still meet my academic goals.</p>
